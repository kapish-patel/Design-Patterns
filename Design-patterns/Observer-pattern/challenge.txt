🚨 Challenge: Weather Station Notification System
🌦️ Scenario:
You're building a backend for a smart weather station. The station collects temperature, humidity, and pressure data every few seconds. Different systems or services want to get notified when the weather data changes.

🧱 Requirements:
Subject: WeatherStation
    Has methods to add/remove observers.
    Has a method set_measurements(temp, humidity, pressure) that updates the data and notifies all observers.

Observers:
    PhoneDisplay → logs weather update to a phone screen.
    WebsiteWidget → logs weather update to a web dashboard.
    SmartHomeSystem → reacts to temperature changes (e.g., adjust AC/heater).

Your Goal:
    Implement the Observer Pattern.
    Make each observer print a custom message when it gets updated.
    Make the WeatherStation notify all observers when data changes.

🧠 Bonus 1:
    Allow different observers to subscribe only to specific types of data (e.g., only interested in temperature changes).

💣 Bonus 2 (Advanced):
    Make it event-driven with a WeatherEvent type system:
    e.g., "high_temperature", "low_pressure"
    Observers only get notified of events they subscribed to.
